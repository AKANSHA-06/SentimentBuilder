       "1    hi so after using this mic for about a month i am writing this review so i will be giving the most genuine review about this mic what a beginner needs a budget mic that is pocket friendly yet gives the best output built quality mic piece is very compact and and handy to use size is small so very convenient to carry anywhere you want cable wire is extraordinarily long meters however that is a great plus point long wire makes recording more easier it has a velcro for cable management so not a difficult task to keep the lengthy wire under control weighs around gms there are no batteries included there s a switch on off button while recording you need to switch to camera mode don t really know why its written camera sound quality my recordings have improved considerably with this mic and i am loving it just one complain i have it captures lot of air flow meaning i can hear lot of air of my mouth in the final output even if i record anything while holding the mic from a considerable distance i can hear my breathing sounds sound quality is loud enough and crisp it does capture my room s ceiling fan sound so i can hear that whoosh sound in the background when i am plugged into my earphones i record with the ac on and keep the fan switched off also it comes with a handy pouch to keep your mic safely yaayyy so finally best for production for a beginner like me because at this price it gives ample quality output \n",

       "0  i would say this is the best available mic in this price range this mic can be connected to your dslr smarthones laptops etc pros long wire sound quality is really good and richcons it will pick background noise if you are in a noisy environment but you can use recforge audio recorder app in your smartphone to remove all the noises apart from that it is all gold go for it                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "1  hi so after using this mic for about a month i am writing this review so i will be giving the most genuine review about this mic what a beginner needs a budget mic that is pocket friendly yet gives the best output built quality mic piece is very compact and and handy to use size is small so very convenient to carry anywhere you want cable wire is extraordinarily long meters however that is a great plus point long wire makes recording more easier it has a velcro for cable management so not a difficult task to keep the lengthy wire under control weighs around gms there are no batteries included there s a switch on off button while recording you need to switch to camera mode don t really know why its written camera sound quality my recordings have improved considerably with this mic and i am loving it just one complain i have it captures lot of air flow meaning i can hear lot of air of my mouth in the final output even if i record anything while holding the mic from a considerable distance i can hear my breathing sounds sound quality is loud enough and crisp it does capture my room s ceiling fan sound so i can hear that whoosh sound in the background when i am plugged into my earphones i record with the ac on and keep the fan switched off also it comes with a handy pouch to keep your mic safely yaayyy so finally best for production for a beginner like me because at this price it gives ample quality output    \n",
       "2  product quality was good not bad the build was also good but one thing i want to say that please mention that it require a connector to connect with dslr most of entry level dslr or should provide a connector for dslr that is very useful and helpful for the customers because the connecter not available in any local market and when it buy through online shops some of it does not support the mic facility so we cannot get a proper product which support the mic and dslr i bought the product about i think weeks ago but still the product is in new condition that is it is in the box only because i did not get any connector suitable to connect with dslr and mic so kindly provide your own genuine connector for connecting with dslr it is a good and helpful for customers who is buying this product most of all customers are buying it for dslr so kindly do it for your valuable customers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
